<p><strong><a name="Register"></a>How do I register for an account, so I can enter data?</strong><br>
          Creating an account 
        must be done by your direct supervisor. Please contact them to fulfil this request.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Bug" id="Bug"></a>Need to report a bug?</strong><br>
If you are experiencing an issue with the website, you may share it with the programming team to have it resolved. Please visit us <a href="http://www.adventurelearningat.com/his/client/issues/index.php" target="_blank">here</a>, register for an account, and post the request by clicking &quot;Create Issue&quot; in the &quot;Issue Tracker.&quot;</p>
<p><strong><a name="SourceVsSite" id="Bug3"></a>What's the difference between a Source and a Site?</strong><br>
  A &quot;Source&quot; is the institution, school, or other organization that is collecting data and coordinating the work being conducted. Sites, on the other hand, are locations or places where data is collected. Sites have a specific set of parameters (things like name, latitude, longitude, and elevation) which uniquely identifiy them from other Sites even when they may be close by one another.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Successful" id="Bug2"></a>How do I know if my data were entered successfully?</strong><br>
   When data (or any other function) is submitted, the page will always display a success action message. The system is also built to notify you of missing or empty fields before the form may be submitted to the database.</p>
<p><strong><a name="DeleteValues" id="Bug4"></a>Can I delete values if I realize I entered something incorrectly?</strong><br>
   If you enter a value  that is incorrect or needs to be changed, please contact your direct supervisor immediately. They have the authority  needed to edit or delete the  data from the table.</p>
<p><strong><a name="AddMethod" id="Bug5"></a>How do I add new method?</strong><br>
   Only an Administrator has the authority to add new methods to the system. Please contact them with the necessary information to fulfil this request. They will associate the new method with the approapriate Types (or Variables) in the database.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Questions"></a>Still have questions?</strong><br>
        If you do not see your question or  answer you're seeking, please contact your direct supervisor about these additional  questions.</p>
         <p><strong><a name="CreatSite" id="CreatSite"></a>Ready to create a site of your own?</strong><br>
