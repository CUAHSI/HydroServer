# CUAHSI HydroServer

This repostitory contains the legacy code for the CUAHSI HydroServer software stack. HydroServer was originally hosted in Microsoft's CodePlex system, but was moved here when Codeplex was shut down.

# Summary

HydroServer is a set of software applications for publishing hydrologic datasets for an experimental watershed or site on the Internet.  HydroServer's software components leverage commercial software such as Microsoft SQL Server and ESRI's ArcGIS Server as well as versions that run on more open platforms using Linux and open relational database management systems like MySQL.

# HydroServer Team

HydroServer was created as part of an open software development project. It's original development was part of the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) Hydrologic Information System (HIS) project that was supported by the National Science Foundation in support of the Hydrologic Science community. Contributers to the original code base include many individuals at Utah State University, developers at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, and others.

# CUAHSI HIS Project Overview

The U.S. National Science Foundation supported Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences (CUAHSI - http://www.cuahsi.org) Hydrologic Information System (HIS) is comprised of databases and servers, connected through web services, to client applications, allowing for for the publication, discovery and access of data. The CUASHI HIS tools have been under development and deployment for several years and together present a relatively complete software “stack” that supports the consistent storage and publication of hydrologic and other environmental observation data. 

HydroServers are one of the 3 main types of computers that are part of the HIS system. They are used by the system to store and serve hydrologic data to other computers. There are numerous ways to set-up servers that meet some or all of the requirements necessary to function as a HydroServer.  Currently some, but not all of the HydroServer software components have versions for both Windows and Linux servers. Operational support for HydroServer applications is now provided by CUAHSI as part of thier Water Data Services. 

The list of legacy HydroServer software components includes:

* Observations Data Model (ODM) Version 1.1
* ODM Tools
* ODM Data Loader
* ODM Web Data Loader
* ODM Streaming Data Loader
* WaterML Web Services
* Capabilities Database, Capabilities Database Configuration Tool, and Capabilities Web Services
* HydroServer Web Site
* HydroServer Time Series Anlayst
* HydroServer Map Web Application
* HydroServer Interactive Web Client

# Sponsors

HyderServer development received support from a number of agencies and complementary efforts including CUAHSI, the Inland Northwest Research Alliance (INRA), and the National Science Foundation.
